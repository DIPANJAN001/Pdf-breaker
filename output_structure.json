It is growing day by day because of the vast level of industrialization and urbanization, causing massive damage to flora and fauna of the planet. Every moment, we are breathing air that is full of pollutants, going to our lungs, impregnating our blood and then the whole body, causing uncountable health problems. Both state and central governments have put in many efforts to keep air pollution under control. The proposed paper discusses an efficient approach towards the prediction of air quality index (AQI) of Delhi, India. AQI is a measure of air quality. It is used to inform citizens about the associated health impacts of air pollution exposure. So, we modelled a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict hourly based concentrations of pollutants. These concentrations are then used to calculate AQI. The proposed LSTM model achieved good results in estimating hourly based ambient air quality. "

INTRODUCTION Air pollution is the introduction of particulates, biological molecules, or other harmful substances into the Earth’s atmosphere. It is a global concern and a major environmental health problem. It is the fifth leading risk factor for mortality worldwide. People are dying more because of air pollution than malnutrition, road traffic injuries, and alcohol use [1]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 9 out of 10 people around the world breathe polluted air. Every year, around 7 million people die from exposure to air pollution [2]. One-third of deaths from heart disease, lung cancer, and stroke are due to air pollution [3]. The quality of life in a place is measured using several factors in which air quality plays a vital role. Its measurement is based on the concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere and is called AQI. AQI is a method that transforms the weighted values of individual "

      "text": "air pollution-related parameters (for example, pollutant concentrations) into a single number or set of numbers. In the AQI system, specific concentration ranges are grouped into air quality descriptor categories [4].India is a developing country. With urbanization and industrialization, air pollution in India is also increasing. Many harmful gases are released to the atmosphere by industrialization processes.Automobile emissions, fires on agricultural land, construction sites dust, burning garbage are a significant contributor to air pollution in India.By particulate matter concentration, 22 of the 30 most polluted cities in the world are in India [5]. Delhi, India’s capital territory, is ranked the world’s most polluted capital and is at 11th position overall [6]. To understand and measure ambient air quality in India, the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change developed and launched the AQI system on 17-October-2014 [7]. In Indian AQI System (IND-AQI), the following eight pollutants are considered for calculation of AQI: CO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, O3, NH3, and Pb. To present the status of air quality and its effects on human health, the following six air quality description categories have been adopted: Good, Satisfactory, Moderately polluted, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe [4]. Table 1 shows the concentration range and the health statements for AQI categories. In all these years, conventional approaches are used for ambient air quality assessments. Manual analysis of raw data is carried out in these approaches. According to Niharika et al. [8], traditional approaches use statistical and mathematical techniques for air quality prediction. However, these methods are inefficient, complex, and provide limited accuracy. With recent advancement in technology and research, novel air quality assessment techniques have been modelled. Deep Learning is one such technique and has accomplished remarkable results in solving real-life problems of various domains. Handwriting recognition [9], speech recognition [10], [11], [12], natural language processing [13] are some of the areas where deep Air Quality Index Prediction of Delhi using LSTM "

RNN is a popular deep learning architecture that is used to model sequential data. It contains cyclic connections where the outputs from previous time steps are fed as input to the current time step. In RNNs, errors are backpropagated, and weights are updated using a technique called Back Propagation Through Time (BPTT). However, while training an RNN, there occur problems of vanishing and exploding gradients. With many layers in the neural network model, the gradient output, the error, if greater than 1, leads to very large values of the gradients to be used for further calculation. This is called the exploding gradient problem, due to which the trainable weights have considerable changes in their values for each iteration, which increase the impact of the initial layers on the output. Whereas, when the gradients are less than 1, their effect on the gradients of the initial layers is minimal. So, to lessen the effect of these problems, LSTM [15] was introduced. LSTM is a specific RNN architecture that was designed to model temporal sequences and their long-range dependencies more accurately than conventional RNNs. It contains special units called memory blocks in the recurrent hidden layers. The memory blocks contain memory cells with self-connections storing the temporal state of the network in addition to special multiplicative units called the gates to control the flow of information. There have been several approaches to predict air quality. Kumar and Goyal forecasted daily AQI for Delhi using a combination of both ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) and PCR (Principal Component Regression) statistical models [16]. Ni et al. compared multiple statistical models on PM2.5 data around Beijing which exposed that linear regression models can perform better than other models in some cases [17]. Li et al. devised multiple linear regressions’ technique for air quality estimation [18]. Bing-Chun Liu et al. came up with a model of collaborative forecasting of AQI of three cities in China using Support Vector Regression. They took air quality information and meteorological conditions of multiple cities as input [19]. Nieto et al. built a non-linear dynamic model, Support Vector Regressor to determine the factors affecting the air quality in Oviedo urban area (Norther Spain) [20]. Jain and Khare used an adaptive neuro-fuzzy model to predict hourly CO concentrations with prediction accuracy varying from 89 to 93% [21]. Athnasiadis et al. analyzed weather and air quality data using the σ-FLNMAP classifier to estimate ozone concentration levels and categorizing them into three classes, namely, high, medium, and low [22]. These conventional approaches are inefficient and require prior knowledge of data distribution. Moreover, these methods could not model long-range dependencies of data accurately. Athira et al. used different deep learningbased architectures to predict air quality in China. They trained RNN, LSTM, and GRU based neural networks for predicting future PM10 concentration [23]. Xiang et al. proposed an LSTME (Long Short Term Memory Extended) model for predicting air pollutants concentration in Beijing city [24]. Reddy et al. developed a deep air system for forecasting air pollution in China [25].Krishan et a constructed LSTM model to predict the concentration of PM2.5, NOx, O3, and CO at a particular location in Delhi. They evaluated the model performance for 2008-2010 data and found that the LSTM model is beneficial in ambient air quality forecasting [26]. Rao et al. contributed to forecasting air ambiance in Visakhapatnam with LSTM based RNN. They predicted the hourly concentration of ten pollutants considering six weather parameters with temporal sequence data of each of the pollutants [27]. "

It is bordered by Haryana state on three sides and by Uttar Pradesh to the east [28]. The current population of Delhi is around 19 million. According to the United Nations’ World Urbanization Prospects, Delhi would become the most populous city in the worldby 2028 [29]. Although many steps have been taken to control air pollution, none of them have been much productive. Dwarka is chosen asresearch location for our study. It is a sub-city in South-West district of Delhi and a short distance away from Gurugram, which is the world’s most polluted city [5]. Dwarka is one of the pollution hotspots of Delhi [30]. The data for the concentration of pollutants and meteorological parameters were collected from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) [31] where data is publicly available for 18 states that contain 102 cities with a total of 170 stations (locations). Data was collected for station NSUT (formerly NSIT), located in Sector-3, Dwarka [32]. The reason is that NSUT data were densely populated with only a few gaps (non-allocated values) counting to a few days to a few weeks in a year as compared to other stations. So, data for 3.5 years was selected for the purpose. The timeline of the data is from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2017 and 1 October 2017 to 1 April 2019. Data from 1 April 2017 to 30 September 2017 was not available. The set of air pollutants and meteorological parameters used in this research are shown in tables 2 and 3. "

This was handled by setting the outliers to null values. The missing data present in the dataset acts as noise which affects the performance of the forecasting model.  So, the missing data was populated using the technique called interpolation [33]. It is a method of constructing new data points within a range of a discrete set of known data points. It can be linear, bilinear, piecewise, polynomial, spline, cubic, bicubic, etc. The linear interpolation technique was used to fill the missing values. So, the final dataset considered has 35088 samples for each pollutant and the weather parameters. The descriptive statistics of the data are shown in Table 4: "

The input gate controls the flow of input activations into the memory cell, while the output gate controls the output flow of cell activation into the rest of the network. The forget gate addresses a weakness of LSTM models preventing them from processing continuous input streams that are not segmented into subsequences. It scales the internal state of the cell before adding it as input to the cell through the self-recurrent connection of the cell, therefore adaptively forgetting or resetting the cell’s memory.

An AQI is formulated using two steps: (i) formation of sub-indices (for each pollutant) and (ii) aggregation of sub-indices to get an overall AQI.  A sub- index for each pollutant is calculated to represent a relationship between pollutant concentrations and their health effects. The sub-indices for individual pollutants are calculated using their 24-hourly average concentration value (8-hourly in case of CO and Ozone) and health breakpoint concentration range [4]. Health breakpoint concentration range for IND-AQI system is shown in table 5. The sub-index (ܫ௉) for a given pollutant concentration (ܥ௉), as based on linear segmented principle, is calculated as: ܫ௉= ቂቄ ூಹ಺ିூಽೀ ஻ಹ಺ି஻ಽೀቅ ∗ (ܥ௉−ܤ௅ை)ቃ +ܫ௅ை  (6) where ܤுூ: Breakpoint concentration greater or equal to a given concentration ܤ௅ை: Breakpoint concentration smaller or equal to given concentration ܫுூ: AQI value corresponding to ܤுூ ܫ௅ை: AQI value corresponding to ܤ௅ை Mathematical functions are used to aggregatesub-indices, ܫ௉ to obtain the overall index (ܫ), referred to as AQI.

Dropout layers randomly drop units from the network during training and prevent unit from co-adapting too much [42]. The model is trained for 50 epochs for a batch size of 15 using RMSprop optimizer.

This paper proposed an RNN-LSTM model that predicts the hourly concentration of pollutants present in the air. The predicted concentrations are then used to calculate the AQI for a particular region in Delhi. The present study is carried out on 3.5 years ofhourly data from April 2015 to March 2019 with data from April 2017 to September 2017 was not available. Temporal sequences of four meteorological parameters and pollutant levels is fed as input to the LSTM model. The results show that deep learning-based techniques carry out promisingly than conventional statistical methods. This work can be extended by predicting a higher number of future timesteps for all the eight pollutants considered in calculating AQI. "
